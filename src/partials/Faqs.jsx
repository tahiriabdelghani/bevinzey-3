                Easily adjust your Bevinzey plan to suit your needs at any time.
                Any unused credits from your current plan will be applied to
                your new bill. If you upgrade in the middle of your billing
                cycle, you'll receive a pro-rated discount on the new plan's
                monthly subscription fee.

                Option 1: Increase Your Monthly Capacity with an Upgrade As your
                content needs grow, upgrade to a higher monthly limit for
                reduced cost per word. Please note: unused words will not be
                carried over to the next month. Option 2: Maximize Your Credits
                at the Beginning of Each Billing Cycle.
